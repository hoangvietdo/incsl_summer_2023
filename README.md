## Welcome to iNCSL Robotics Summer Camp 2023
        Intelligent Navigation and Control Systems Laboratory
      Department of Convergence Engineering for Intelligent Drone
    School of Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering, Sejong University
### 1. Overview
This project guides you through a simple process of autonomously driving a 4-wheeled mobile robot along a predetermined smooth trajectory using ROS (Robot Operating System). We will start by simulating the robot's behavior in ROS and then transition to implementing the same approach on a real-world robot.

Duration: At most two weeks.

Tasks will be assigned, and upon completion, you will earn certain points.

### 2. Goals
- Understand the basic concepts of Ubuntu (Command-line interface), ROS (topic, launch, node, message, etc), and Github.
- Create a simple ROS package (project) that includes our control algorithm (code).
- Design a controller to drive a mobile robot automatically.
- Implementing the controller programmatically and evaluating its performance in ROS's simulation and on a real-world robot.
- Learn how to record the dataset (rosbag) from the sensor if necessary (only IMU and GPS) and perform analysis using MATLAB.

### 3. Robot Platform
- AgileX Scout Mini.
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.
- ROS: Noetic / Foxy.
- Programming Language: C++ / Python.
